    <h2>Experience</h2>
    <h3>
        I have some voluntary teaching experience, taken classes on topics like Data Structures and Algorithms. I have also conducted introductory sessions on Competitive Programming. All of which were on my own initiative, 
        to help my university juniors as well as working on my own knowledge and understanding on said topics.
        Currently, I am looking for opportunities in fields related to software engineering. You can find my CV <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RDLCOmHC1y_q__TnsZFE81bCVUmGdotN/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here</a>.
