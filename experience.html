    <h2>Experience</h2>
    <p>
        I have voluteery teaching experience, from conducting few classes on <b>Data Structures</b>
        and <b>Algorithms</b> to help friends and juniors from my university. I have also conducted
        inroductory classes on <b>Competitive Programming</b> where I glanced over the basic topics
        and frequently used concepts(e.g. Prefix Array, Trie, Segment Tree, etc.) in sports programming.
        These efforts did not just help my fellows, it also helped me practice and hone my skills.
        Currently, I am looking for opportunities in fields related to software engineering. You can find my CV
