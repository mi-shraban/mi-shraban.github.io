        I have voluteery teaching experience, from conducting few classes on Data Structures and Algorithms to help friends and juniors from my university. I have also conducted inroductory classes on Competitive Programming where I glanced over the basic topics and algorithms frequently used in sports programming. These efforts did not just help my fellows, it also helped me practice and hone my skills. Currently, I am looking for opportunities in fields related to software engineering.
