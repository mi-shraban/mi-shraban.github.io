    <h2>Experience</h2>
    <p>
        I have voluteery teaching experience, from conducting few classes on <b>Data Structures</b>
        and <b>Algorithms</b> to help friends and juniors from my university. I have also conducted
        inroductory classes on <b>Competitive Programming</b> where I glanced over the basic topics
        and frequently used concepts(e.g. <b>Prefix Array</b>, <b>Trie</b>, <b>Segment Tree</b>, etc.)
        in sports programming. These efforts did not just help my fellows, it also helped me practice
        and hone my skills. Currently, I am looking for opportunities in fields related to software
        engineering. You can find my CV <a href="CV_viewer.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
