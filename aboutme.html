    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello there! This is Monowarul Islam, but you can also call me as Shraban. I am a final
        year Computer Science student at <a href="https://bracu.ac.bd" class="ab_link" target="_blank">Brac
        University</a>, Dhaka. I have a passion for problem-solving and I have participated in
        various programming contests over the years and practiced problems solving on Codeforce,
        you can find my solution codes with the problems <a href="CFsolves.html" class="ab_link" target="_blank">here</a>.
        In the academic side, my research interests include data science, machine learning and deep learning.
        I have also gained experience by working on a few <a href="#projects" onclick="loadContent('projects.html')">projects</a>
        which required me to study about Machine Learning (<i>Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow</i>), Robotics (<i>ESP32, Arduino Uno, C++</i>) and Web
        Development (<i>PHP, HTML, CSS</i>). Alongside that, I am currently working on my undergrad thesis
        which is a research project on Cyber-Security which incorporates machine learning based solutions.
        My research role includes optimizing ML models, handling large datasets and implementing the ML
        algorithms to produce optimal results. Alongside that, I am also looking for opportunities to gain industry experience
        and implement my skills in the real world environment. You can find my resume <a href="pdfs/CV.pdf" class="ab_link" target="_blank">here</a>.
        <br>
        On my free time, I enjoy playing video games, solving problems, watching movies, TV series and animes.
        Some of my all-time favorites are
        <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6161168/" target="_blank">Red Dead Redemption II</a>,
        <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111161/" target="_blank">The Shawshank Redemption</a>,
        <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0903747/" target="_blank">Breaking Bad</a>, and
        <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0434706/" target="_blank">Monster</a>.
