    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello there! This is Monowarul Islam, but you can also call me as Shraban. I am a final year Computer Science
        student at <a href="https://bracu.ac.bd" target="_blank">Brac University</a>, Dhaka. I have a passion for problem-solving and
        have participated in various programming contests over the years. Also, I have gained experience working on a few projects which
        required me to study Machine Learning (<i>Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow</i>), Robotics (<i>ESP32, Arduino Uno, C++</i>) and Web
        Development (<i>PHP, HTML, CSS</i>), so I possess knowledge on these topics as well.
        Alongside that, I am currently working on my undergrad thesis which is a research project on Cyber-Security.
        </br></br>As I said previously, I like to solve problems on various websites, mostly on codeforces. You can find
        the problems I have solved in <a href="https://www.stopstalk.com/user/profile/xordan77" target="_blank">here</a>.
        I also love playing video games on my free time. I mostly play online FPS and racing games nowadays. I love clicking on pixels and
        pressing 'W' to win.
